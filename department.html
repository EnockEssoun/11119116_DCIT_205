        <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Computer Science is the study of the theoretical and practical aspects of computer technology and computer usage. The Department offers courses on a wide range of topics, many of which include mathematical components. CSUC offers both Certificates Programmes and Bachelor of Science degrees, in Computer Science and Information Technology. Besides offering instructional courses, the Computer Science Department engages in substantial research programmes in which both advanced certificates and undergraduate students participate. The following programmes are available to interested students;</p>

                        <h2> BSc. Computer Science</h2>
                        <p>The Department of Computer Science (CS) offers Certificate in Applications Development, Certificate in Business Applications, Certificate in Computer Hardware and Networking and BSc in Computer Science degree. The Department also hosts a Cisco Certified Network Associates (CCNA) programme, where students are trained by our dynamic lecturers for the external examinations. Areas of research include analysis of computer security, computer applications in education, algorithms, neural networks, computer graphics, computer animation, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and retrieval, machine learning, neural networks, computer graphics, computer animation, scientific visualization, computer and sensor vision, image processing, software engineering, web and internet engineering, real-time embedded systems, computer security, databases, parallel and distributed computation, operating systems, and storage systems, image synthesis, multimodal human-computer interaction, programming languages and environments.
                        The certificate programmes are usually computer within three months, while the degree programme is four years.The Bachelor of Science programme is appropriate for students desiring a somewhat stronger concentration in the sciences, with more courses in computer science and computer engineering as well as courses in physics or mathematics; this programme also allows for electives outside of the sciences.</p>
                    
                    

                        <h2> Programme Objectives</h2>
                        <p>Infusion of biblical courses into professional training to ensure healthy moral education and spiritual development of students;
                        Addressing the College's vision and mission of training
                        manpower for the Church and other para-church institutions. Expansion to cover business and computer science studies will also equip trainees in theology with the necessary management and computer skills to perform better;
                        Filling the yawning market for secondary school graduates and workers who are desirous of pursuing business education at the degree level;
                        Addressing its cardinal aim of training church workers and others in analogous positions, The turnout rate of business and science graduates from the business and science departments of secondary schools in the northern sector including Ashanti Region and its environs is so huge that many of those who qualify to go to the universities and polytechnics do not get admission. It is for this and other reasons that the Christian. Service University College (CSUC) wants to expand its academic programme further beyond Theology and Business studies to be able to address the problem of science students who do not get admission to pursue science related studies at the degree level.</p>
                    
                    
                        <h2>Career Prospects</h2>
                        <p>Generally, degree courses in computer science appear to be attractive to science students. It is worth noting that many graduates in the sciences and the arts who occupy responsible managerial positions are pursuing Master of Business Administration (Management Information Systems option), Master of Science in Information Technology, and Master of Science in Software Engineering and other analogous programmes in Computer Science.
                        High Standards of admission to Computer Science courses in the universities are clear indications of the overwhelming number of students who desire to pursue Computer Science courses at the universities.
                        A critical observation of advertisements on job vacancies in the daily newspapers reveals that many of the job vacancies are in areas such as Computer Science and other related courses in computing and business studies. Students who pursue courses in computer science and business are often better pre-disposed to get jobs than their counterparts in the non-business and non-computer courses.
                        There is therefore no doubt that candidates who get the opportunity to pursue Christian Service University College's Bachelor of Computer Science programme stand a good chance of getting jobs on the job market. In case they would like to be entrepreneurs or self-employed, the course will give them the necessary skills and exposure.</p>
