## Overview of the website
This is my first website assigned to be by the department of computer science as my Interim Assessment Preject. This website allows users to discover and explore more about the department of computer science. It contains 10 webpages with each containing different information which would be useful to users.

## Steps on Cloning

1. Open Visual Studio Code and launch the bash terminal.

2. In Visual Studio Code, open the following link in your browser: https://github.com/Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA

3. On the GitHub page for "DCIT_205_IA," locate the "Fork" button and click on it.

4. Name your forked repository using the following convention: "STUDENT_ID_DCIT205."

5. From the "Code" button dropdown on your forked repository, copy the HTTPS link provided under the "Clone" section.

6. In your Visual Studio Code bash terminal, paste the copied link after the command git clone. For example:

bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/STUDENT_ID_DCIT205.git

7. Observe that a README.md file appears in your current folder directory.

If your additional code files are in a different directory, cut or copy those files and paste them into the folder where your README.md file is located. This folder should have the name you used when forking Daquiver1's repo for the IA, following the naming convention "STUDENT_ID_DCIT205."

8. Activate your folder directory by using the command:

12. git commit -m "Enter any commit message"

13. Push the committed files to your GitHub repository using the command:
